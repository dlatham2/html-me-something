        <p>It’s pure nail ripping torture for me to venture to my place of occupation every day, in my short sleeved
            orange shirt and navy blue jean shorts that are cuffed at the bottom. Operating the train at the zoo is the
            most exhilarating part of my day. The manner in which my arm tugs at the chain activating the horn brings
            zeal to my soul. Every centimeter of my limb appeared exceedingly beautiful, and I was forced to peek – like
            a shy school girl – at my other arm. How gorgeous my skin looked, each thin golden hair laid peacefully
            against my cinnamon oatmeal colored pelt. The fresh vanilla odor entered my nose from the lotion I had
            applied earlier that day. It made my skin sparkle, and I was tremendously eager to get off work and arrive
            home. </p>

        <p>I was relieved when five o’ clock arrived. My shift was over and I was elated to go home. I drove rapidly
            through afternoon traffic, my legs performed perfectly -- pressing the brake pedal progressively harder at
            each halting signal. The rollercoaster movement of my knees pleased me; there was a smile on my face. After
            about ten minutes of constant harassment, I reached my home—the safe haven in which I could please myself—my
            safety net. I entered my home; the smell of glue filled my nostrils and the true sense of my location
            settled in my mind. I scurried to my room, anticipating the moment in which I’d been waiting for. My desk
            was desolate, with the exception of a white towel to clean up my mess. Sitting down at my desk, I looked at
            my arms, they were filthy and I felt disgusted. I rushed to the bathroom, threw off my orange shirt and navy
            pants, then softly tip toed into the sauna that waited patiently for me. My skin looked ravishing, I spread
            the cream colored soap over my body and gazed at the manner in which it oozed across my body’s surface. My
            mouth began to water, and I could wait no more.</p> <img src="images/download.jpeg" alt=arm />

        <p>In my room, I sat on my bed air drying a little because it’s always best for the skin to be a bit damp when
            starting the process. The chair at my desk was pulled out as if it was welcoming me to sit. I sat there and
            placed my arms on the towel, and my pupils began to swell as my mouth watered. I glided my index and middle
            finger gently across my left arm, tickling it a little. My mind wondered to a blissful place. At the bend in
            my arm, my nails mined into my skin and a gasp of relief escaped my mouth. I then proceeded to pull the
            strip of skin toward my hand, the blood flowed sensually down my arm and colored the towel beneath it – my
            mouth watered. The veins throbbed in my arm and crossed each other in an intricate and dazzling fashion. I
            retrieved a knife from the right side of my desk draw, and cut the strip of skin off from wrist. My arm laid
            there, the strip of skin missing – a red Nile River. I dangled the strip of skin in front of my mouth, I
            enjoyed teasing myself sometimes.<img src="images/Red nile.jpeg" ALIGN="right" alt=Nile River /> <BR CLEAR="right"/> Then I couldn’t resist, my
            tongue reeled in the flesh, and I bit off a piece. Juices rushed into my mouth, and my teeth chewed what
            tasted like a fruit roll up. The soft tissues that lie under the skin, massaged my tongue and a smile came
            across my face as I wiped blood from the corner of my mouth. It had been so long since I’d had a taste of my
            delicious flesh, so long since warm blood filled my mouth and oh so long since the orgasmic feeling surged
            through my body. </p>

        <p>I was content, satisfied, and extremely relieved. Wrapping my tongue around my fingers, I drew the remaining
            blood from each appendage. The once white towel was red, yet I bound it tightly around my forearm and took
            duct tape from the draw in which I retrieved my knife and secured my wrap. I stood over the remaining crime
            scene and thought of how I’d have to find a long sleeve shirt to wear for a few months, when my mother
            entered my room.</p>

        <p>My mother discovered my obsession that day, and then proceeded to register me into our local mental
            institution. Here they torture me, and force me to wear strait jackets; however they can’t cease my dreams.
            The bittersweet taste of blood tingles my senses, while the feeling of my skin ripping delicately makes my
            body quake. Others may believe I suffer from insanity, but in reality, I enjoy every single second of it.
